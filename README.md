## About Me
I am a full stack web developer with 6 months of experience. Proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, express and MongoDB,  I have built several web applications. 

My most notable project is <a href="http://covid-info-help.herokuapp.com/">Covid-Info/Help</a> website which won the 1st prize in SVNIT ACM Month of Code challenge. I was also a part of the web development team for a start-up company wherein I used my skills to help build their company website. 

Currently I am active in open-source and would love to contribute to a major organisation someday!
